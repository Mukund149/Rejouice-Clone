# Rejouice Clone

## Overview
This project is a clone of the **Rejouice** website, an interactive web experience focused on modern web design, animations, and smooth user interactions. The clone replicates the core features of Rejouice’s landing page, including custom cursor animations, hover-to-play video reels, text rise animations, and smooth scroll interactions, all implemented using **GSAP** and **Locomotive Scroll**.

The goal of this project was to reverse-engineer the website’s intricate animations and interactions to create a near-identical experience while learning advanced front-end web development techniques.

## Key Features
- **Custom Animated Cursor**: A unique cursor that interacts with the page content and triggers animations.
- **Hover-to-Play Video Reels**: Interactive hover effects that reveal hidden video reels upon mouse interaction.
- **Scroll-Triggered Animations**: Smooth animations and transitions triggered by scrolling, including text and background animations.
- **Text Rise Animations**: Dynamic text effects that rise and fade in as users scroll down the page.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Custom scroll behavior using Locomotive Scroll for a smooth, natural scrolling experience.
  
## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure and content of the page.
- **CSS (Flexbox, Grid)**: Layout and styling, including animations and transitions.
- **JavaScript**:
  - **GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform): For smooth animations and scroll-triggered effects.
  - **Locomotive Scroll**: For smooth scrolling and scroll animations.
  - **Combined with custom animations all over the site**
- **Custom Cursor**: Developed using JavaScript to trigger animations when interacting with page elements.
